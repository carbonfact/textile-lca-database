# Methodology Overview

## General approach

The Carbonfact Textile LCA Database follows a **gate-to-gate** modelling approach for each textile manufacturing process. Datasets represent the environmental impact of transforming an input material (yarn, greige fabric, etc.) into an output product (yarn, fabric, dyed textile) at the factory gate.

Each process is published as a standalone **foreground unit process** referencing the ecoinvent 3.12 background database for upstream inputs (electricity, heat, chemicals, water, waste treatment). The methodology targets the **Environmental Footprint (EF) 3.1** method across 16 impact indicators when characterising results.

> ℹ️ **No pre-calculated impact scores are published in this repository.** The repo ships foreground inventories (`inventory-brightway.xlsx`) only. To compute the EF 3.1 indicators, import the inventories into your LCA tool with a valid [ecoinvent v3.12 license](https://ecoinvent.org/offerings/). See [README §Background data](../README.md#background-data).

## Functional unit

The functional unit is defined per process and specified in each process methodology documentation.

## System boundaries

**Included in each process:**
- Direct electricity consumption (machine operation)
- Indirect energy (HVAC, compressors, lighting, auxiliaries)
- Process-specific inputs (lubricants, sizing agents, dyes, chemicals, water)
- Capital goods (machinery) and their end-of-life
- Building infrastructure (where applicable)
- Yarn/material losses and waste treatment

**Excluded (modelled separately):**
- Upstream fibre and yarn production
- Downstream finishing, assembly, packaging, and distribution
- Use phase and end-of-life of the final product

## Background database

All datasets use **ecoinvent 3.12** (cut-off system model) as the background database. Electricity is modelled using the global market group for medium voltage (`market group for electricity, medium voltage, GLO`) unless a region-specific market is justified.

## Impact assessment method

Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) targets the **EF 3.1** characterisation method across all 16 PEF impact indicators. See [impact-indicators.md](impact-indicators.md) for the full indicator list with codes, names, and units. Pre-calculated scores are not shipped in this repository — apply EF 3.1 in your own LCA tool with an ecoinvent v3.12 license to compute results from the foreground inventories.

## Parameterisation

Many process parameters (electricity consumption, lubricant use, yarn waste) are parameterised by **yarn fineness (dtex)** and **fibre type**. This enables the database to cover a wide range of textile products from a consistent modelling framework. The parameterisation approach is documented in each process methodology:

- [Spinning methodology](../datasets/spinning/methodology/)
- [Knitting methodology](../datasets/knitting/methodology/)
- [Weaving methodology](../datasets/weaving/methodology/)
- [Dyeing methodology](../datasets/dyeing/methodology/)
