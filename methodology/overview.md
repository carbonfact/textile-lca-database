# Methodology Overview

## General approach

The Carbonfact Textile LCA Database follows a **gate-to-gate** modelling approach for each textile manufacturing process. Datasets represent the environmental impact of transforming an input material (yarn, greige fabric, etc.) into an output product (yarn, fabric, dyed textile) at the factory gate.

Each process is modelled as a standalone foreground unit process, linked to the ecoinvent 3.12 background database for upstream inputs (electricity, heat, chemicals, water, waste treatment) and characterised using the **Environmental Footprint (EF) 3.1** method across 16 impact indicators.

## Functional units

| Process | Functional unit |
|---------|----------------|
| Spinning | 1 kg of finished yarn at the spinning mill gate |
| Knitting | 1 kg of knitted fabric |
| Weaving | 1 kg of woven fabric |
| Dyeing | 1 kg of dyed textile |

## System boundaries

**Included in each process:**
- Direct electricity consumption (machine operation)
- Indirect energy (HVAC, compressors, lighting, auxiliaries)
- Process-specific inputs (lubricants, sizing agents, dyes, chemicals, water)
- Capital goods (machinery) and their end-of-life
- Building infrastructure (where applicable)
- Yarn/material losses and waste treatment

**Excluded (modelled separately):**
- Upstream fibre and yarn production
- Downstream finishing, assembly, packaging, and distribution
- Use phase and end-of-life of the final product

## Background database

All datasets use **ecoinvent 3.12** (cut-off system model) as the background database. Electricity is modelled using the global market group for medium voltage (`market group for electricity, medium voltage, GLO`) unless a region-specific market is justified.

## Impact assessment method

Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) is performed using the **EF 3.1** characterisation method, reporting results for all 16 PEF impact indicators. See [impact-indicators.md](impact-indicators.md) for the full indicator list with codes, names, and units.

## Scenarios

Where applicable, datasets are provided for three operating scenarios:

| Scenario | Service life | Hours/day | Days/year | Description |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| WCS (Worst Case) | 10 years | 8 h | 300 | Single shift, shorter lifetime |
| Average | 15 years | 16 h | 300 | Double shift — **used as default** |
| BCS (Best Case) | 20 years | 24 h | 365 | Continuous operation, longest lifetime |

## Parameterisation

Many process parameters (electricity consumption, lubricant use, yarn waste) are parameterised by **yarn fineness (dtex)** and **fibre type**. This enables the database to cover a wide range of textile products from a consistent modelling framework. The parameterisation approach is documented in each process methodology:

- [Knitting methodology](../datasets/knitting/methodology/)
