> Lifecycle assessment datasets for textile printing across continuous, semi-continuous, and batch technologies for multiple ink classes and substrate formats.

**16 datasets** | Functional unit: 1 kg printed fabric/garment | All 16 EF 3.1 impact indicators

## Overview

This process category covers textile printing — the localised application of colorant to form patterns or images on fabric or garments. The system boundary includes direct electricity (printing machines, dryers, steamers), thermal energy (drying, fixation, steaming), inks, auxiliary chemicals (thickeners, fixers, urea), water consumption, and wastewater treatment. Datasets span continuous technologies (rotary screen, digital inkjet), semi-continuous technologies (flat screen, transfer), and batch garment printing, across multiple ink chemistries (pigment, reactive, disperse, sublimation, discharge, burnout).

## Datasets

**Input required (kg)** is the kg of input substrate required per 1 kg of printed output, accounting for fabric losses during printing. Callers scale the upstream substrate input by this factor and add a textile-waste flow for the lost fraction — see the repo-level [Handling material losses](../../README.md#handling-material-losses) note.
