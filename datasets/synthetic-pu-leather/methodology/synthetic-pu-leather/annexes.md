## A. Limitations and caveats

1. **Single patent per leather type** — each variant is based on a single Chinese patent formulation, not an industry average
2. **Estimated electricity** — energy values are derived via the Piccinno et al. (2016) scale-up framework from patent process parameters, not from measured production data
3. **Chinese electricity grid** — all electricity is modeled as CN medium voltage; results are sensitive to grid carbon intensity
4. **No uncertainty or sensitivity analysis** — results are single deterministic values
5. **Areal density assumption** — the 1:1 conversion between m² and kg assumes 1 kg/m² for 1.5-2 mm PU leather
6. **Cradle-to-gate** — excludes transport, use phase, and end-of-life
7. **HTC near-identical** — carcinogenic human toxicity scores are nearly identical for both types; EF 3.1 characterization factors may not fully capture DMF-specific toxicity
8. **No inbound transport** — transport of raw materials to the manufacturing site is not included

## C. Foreground database version note

The Brightway inventory files reference `ecoinvent-3.11-cutoff` as the database name in their exchange matching. The actual background database loaded in the Brightway project `synthetic_leather` is ecoinvent 3.12 cutoff. Impact assessment results were computed against ecoinvent 3.12.
